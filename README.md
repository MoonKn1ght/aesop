# ASOPE: Nested Genetic Algorithm for Automated Search of Optical Processing Experiments

This a scientific computing software for automatically searching for optical experiments that are 'interesting'.

## Getting Started

Well, if you're reading this and you're not the author, I've obviously forgotten to update this README file since I first wrote it. I did not think this code would make it into other peoples hands.

### Prerequisites

All packages needed for this software are open-source, standard Python packages. Most can be installed via `pip install ...`

```
numpy
deap
re
json
...
```

Check each packages site for installation requirements.

### Installing

Nothing special must be done except to download these packages and run from the downloaded folder.
Say what the step will be


## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system


## Built With

* [Anaconda](http://www.anaconda.org) - Standard scientific computing IDE for Python
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org) - Standard scientific computing package

## Contributing

I can't imagine I will ever get to the contributing stage.

## Versioning

Git is used, of course
